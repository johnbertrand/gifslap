MODULES
-


Modules should be independent from eachother, and not rely on the code of other modules.

They are allowed to rely on the code of the core. Specifically, many modules reference values from images{}.

When a module is initialized it usually adds its own element to the DOM, so it can be manipulated independently. Modules elements should be inside #container, because #container is exported to save snapshots of the DOM.
